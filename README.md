# Protocol

Communcation between devices according to strict protocols.

Purpose: To harvest real-world data, transmit it, and then receive it onto another processor, communicators must follow precise protocols. Focus is on data transmission but a centralized design is very useful in many circumstances. WIFI networks, at least in the small scale, rely on this, where many devices connect to a centralized hub.
